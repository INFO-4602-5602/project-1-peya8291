Bell: Styling your Visualization (Done)

I download an old floral paper background and use URL creating background.  In the projector1.css file, I was styling the body part and use different font. I also put a background color (light blue) as back up. I choose this background, because users can clearly see the visualization. User could focus on visualization, not the background.
body {
    font-family: sans-serif;
    font-size: 11px;
    background-image: url("https://static9.depositphotos.com/1280399/1212/i/450/depositphotos_12123001-stock-photo-old-grunge-parchment-background-canvas.jpg");

Whistle: Transitions (Do not complete)

Whistle: Replication(Done)

I use python Jupiter notebook created each visualization. I think python is much easier than D3 JavaScript. Through this project, I found a lot tools can make visualization and they are all easier D3 JavaScript. So I do not understand why we use D3 JavaScript make the visualization.

We make Xs and Ys  bar chart and can highlight Xs bar chart, but the corresponding graph Ys does not highlight
